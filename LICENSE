more info) THEN THE GAME WILL BE TAKEN DOWN!!!! Also the game is base off KP meaning technically KP has the right to take down your game as well even if it uses hazzy's code. How
ever KP is required to provide a GOOD reason why it should be taken down (e.g using stolen assets, or not crediting and claiming you made it) but Drwhomust is able to take your
project down with no reason at all. But highly likely chance of that happening is low due to Drwhomust being too lazy to submit a DMCA request. And also he been DMCA too many
