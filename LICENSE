Drwhomust custom license for hazzy
Base off the ALL RIGHTS RESERVED license 

Copyright (C) 2024 - what ever year it is

This license basically says you are ALLOWED to do the following things

You are able to play the game free of charge 

You are able to use the sprites for your projects. (The sprites are in a different license. Creative Commons Attribution_NonCommercial v4.0 International)

The code is the main point of this license. So here are the conditions. All rights are reserved for Drwhomust but modding is allowed. (Aka making modifications to the original code) And distributing the modify copy of the game. HOW EVER IF YOU BREAK THE RULES (see https://github.com/nightcrawcode/hazzy/wiki/Modding or the modifications documents for more info) THEN THE GAME WILL BE TAKEN DOWN!!!! Also the game is base off KP meaning technically KP has the right to take down your game as well even if it uses hazzy's code. How ever KP is required to provide a GOOD reason why it should be taken down (e.g using stolen assets, or not crediting and claiming you made it) but Drwhomust is able to take your project down with no reason at all. But highly likely chance of that happening is low due to Drwhomust being too lazy to submit a DMCA request. And also he been DMCA too many times so the DMCA guys will probably ignore him. But he can if you break the rules and it can't be resolved within 14 business days.
