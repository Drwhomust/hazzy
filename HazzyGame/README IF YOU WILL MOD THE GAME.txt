HEY HEY HEY MODDERS
*cough* sorry, i was in my spamton voice but anyways
WELCOME TO MODDING HAZZY

most of the docs for this game is in the wiki so check that out the
come back here...

https://drwhomust.gitbook.io/hazzy-wiki/

ALSO DO NOT USE THE DEFULT NW.JS THAT COMES WITH RPG MAKER
IT'S SLOW, PAINFUL TO DEBUG, AND USES A OLDER VERISON OF NODE.JS (WHICH MEANS LESS COMPATIABLY WITH NEW NODE.JS APIS)
DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION OF NW.JS AND BUILD FROM THERE

TOO LAZY TO COPY THE FILES TO THE PLAYER EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TEST SOMETHING OUT?
CHECK THIS GUIDE OUT! https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/how-to-update-nw-js-to-dramatically-improve-game-performance.131620/

and lastly use node.js APIs
the game supports it and the game mostly runs on node.js

anyways have fun
