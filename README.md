# Welcome to hazzy

Welcome to the hazzy project. This is game made by Drwhomust.
where it is a Undertale fan game but with Transfurs.

## What is hazzy?

Hazzy is a Undertale/Deltarune and Transfur fan game. It is based off of Undertale and Deltarune by Toby Fox. And most transfur games but it's mostly on Kaiju Paradise on roblox made by LAMINAX CO and Changed Special by DragonSnow

It was a story like undertale and uses the Undertale Battle system. And it features Goos from a LOT of transfur games, and removed goos (sorry for inclueing them).

*Note, this game is not affiliated to any of these games, toby fox, or even the game engine used.
