# Hazzy

Hazzy is a video game where you play as a goo named Hazzy (a hybird of a fox, cat, and red panda)

You infect your host and have to find a way out of the lab. You run across many goos and humans, you have the choice to fight them. Or spare them

Everything you do has a cause and effect. Depending on your actions. You can many endings

## The project

This is a video game based off the games [Undertale](https://undertale.com/), [Deltarune](https://deltarune.com/), and [Kaiju Pardise](https://www.roblox.com/games/6456351776/)
And many more games come into play about this game's lore

I created this game from an idea of "What if KP had deltarune's battles" and "What if both humans and goos live in unison" and from those two ideas, This game was made

This game uses Undertale's Battle system, and music but has a story like deltarunes but with charaters (goos specific) from Kaiju Paradise with a unqine twist

I gotten a lot of inspiration from a lot of games when writing the lore and making the game but game's the break the 4th wall (mostly the ones that have the charater take control of the users computer to show how much
they are self aware) stoold out to me the most. And I made most of the game's mechanics and story follow along that. I most took inspiration from OneShot, Doki Doki, and Undertale itself when making the 4th wall breaks

Overall the lore is based off an old fanfic of the idea "What if both humans and goos live in unison" with 4th wall breaks and it also uses stuff from undertale and deltarune

### project in code

This project was made in GoDot

It uses GDScript with a *intersering* code base

~~(i am so sorry for anyone reading my code 😭)~~

and the project is made and opimazeed to run on a lot of stuff

(i am making it where the game is very opimazed it can run on anything like doom)

It also has support for mobile controls. and Keyboard, and even controlloer

### legacy hazzy

The legacy version of hazzy was an old version made in RPG Maker using JavaScript.

The code is very bad and i stopped working on it because of that.
It has caused many problems (both backend and front end) and it wasn't worth on working on,

That's why i left it in faver for the new recode (aka this, the GoDot version)

You can still view it here, but be warned. It's very buggy and the code is a mess

> If you are seeing this quoat block and the "here" is not a link it means i haven't made the branch and likey the code is still being made

# How can I contribute?

Good question 🙂

You can:

- Open issues if you find bugs
- Help me fix bugs
- Help me port to more platforms
- Or just slime and play the game

You don't have to but some extra help would be nice.
