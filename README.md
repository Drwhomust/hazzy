# Welcome to Hazzy!

Hello and welcome to hazzy! This is a open source fan game!

## Wait... What is it exactly?

Hazzy is a Fan Game between the games Undertale by toby fox, Kaiju Paradise on Roblox, and Changed by Dragonsnow!

This is a fan game where it explore a story similar to Undertale but unlike in most transfur games.

You get to play as the goo! You play as Hazzy, a Fox, Cat, Red Panda hybrid that just transfured your host.

but instead something went wrong during the process of the mind control and the taking over of the host mind that

You player ended up with the contral! Now you have to guide hazzy on paths, where will you take it.

Are you going to be kind to both the goo creatures and humans or are you going to end them?

That's up to you my friend
