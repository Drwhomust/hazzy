## Welcome to hazzy Wiki

Welcome to the hazzy Wiki! This wiki has everything from character info, lore, and all the docs for modding the game! so half of the wiki is game wiki and other half is modding

### So what now?

Well, you can go and see how to [install the game](how-to-install-the-game.md). go check that out.

if not maybe check on how to [mod the game](/broken/pages/qHgqQLAm6v7VS7YDbLoJ). or even see all the [character info](game-info-aka-lore/characters-main.md) (it has some good lore)
