Contributing to this game is really really helpful for me!

Even though i want to work alone on this, i do not mind if you help me get some stuff done faster!

Here are some guide lines when contributing to this project:

# Guide lines

- Biggest one **Please do not add any content of your own. I want to make this game how i want it**. just please
  i wrote a really big story for the lore (like the google doc for it is like 50 pages long) so i want this game
  to be like how i planned it out
- When helping with code use `snake-case`, yes yes i know. it's not the best but i use snake case everywhere and it's habit for me
- Keep code clean!!! I don't want stinky code, i am not making the same mistake i did in the leagcy verison of hazzy
- i follow up above, **code comment everything!!!**. even if it's just a basic `print("hello world")` code comment it!!!
  it helps me and modders/forks work on the game

now with that out of the way

# Getting started!

So, you can read the Docs for the game or just the code comments to learn how the game functions. And start helping on the game
