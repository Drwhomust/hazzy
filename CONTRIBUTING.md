Contributing to this game is really really helpful for me!

Even though i want to work alone on this, i do not mind if you help me get some stuff done faster!

Here are some guide lines when contributing to this project:

# Guide lines

- Biggest one **Please do not add any content of your own. I want to make this game how i want it**. just please
  i wrote a really big story for the lore (like the google doc for it is like 50 pages long) so i want this game
  to be like how i planned it out
- **NO AI IS ALLOWED**! the use of Ai or using the conpect of "vibe coding" to contribute to this project is not allowed because Ai is bad!! If you attempt to submit Ai generated code not only it **will** get rejected but also **you will receive a community ban** we do not welcome Ai in this community
- When helping with code use `snake-case`, yes yes i know. it's not the best but i use snake case everywhere and it's habit for me
- Keep code clean!!! I don't want stinky code, i am not making the same mistake i did in the leagcy verison of hazzy
- a follow up above, **code comment everything!!!**. even if it's just a basic `print("hello world")` code comment it!!!
  it helps me and modders/forks work on the game
- And lastly, keep everything static! Even though I love dynamic programming languages. I want to extend the compatibility of the game.
  Because C++ is static. Having the game be static makes it easier to compile GDScript to C++

soooo when you use variables

| what to do | example: |
|------------|----------|
| Do this ✔️ | `var variable_name: = value` |
| Not this ✖️ | `var variable_name = value` |

now with that out of the way

# Getting started!

what now????

So, you can read the Docs for the game or just the code comments to learn how the game functions. And start helping on the game

## What do i need to do?

You can check on the [issues](https://github.com/Drwhomust/hazzy/issues) page to see what's needed to fixed or worked on
