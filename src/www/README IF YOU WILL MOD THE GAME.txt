HEY HEY HEY MODDERS
*cough* sorry, i was in my spamton voice but anyways
WELCOME TO MODDING HAZZY

most of the docs for this game is in the wiki so check that out the
come back here...

https://drwhomust.gitbook.io/hazzy-wiki/

welcome back now here is a quick run down of everything in the game's
files. One is when using RPG Maker DO NOT DEPLOY THE PROJECT FROM RPG MAKER
STUFF WILL BREAK IF YOU DO
instead just save everything in this folder and make sure it's with NW.JS so it can
do it's thing to run the game

and lastly use node.js APIs
the game supports it and the game mostly runs on node.js

anyways have fun
