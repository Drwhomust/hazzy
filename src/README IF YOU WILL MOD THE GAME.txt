HEY HEY HEY MODDERS
*cough* sorry, i was in my spamton voice but anyways
WELCOME TO MODDING HAZZY

most of the docs for this game is in the wiki so check that out the
come back here...

https://github.com/nightcrawcode/hazzy/wiki/Modding

welcome back now here is a quick run down of everything in the game's
files. One is when using RPG Maker DO NOT DEPLOY THE PROJECT FROM RPG MAKER
STUFF WILL BREAK IF YOU DO
instead just save everything in this folder and NW.js will handle the rest.
once you saved your work come back here and go up 1 time and run NW (or hazzy.exe on windows
or hazzy.app on MacOS)

also try to use TypeScrpirt and covert it to JS


and lastly use node.js APIs
the game supports it

anyways have fun
