ok but jokes aside. I take Security seriously, dispite the game looking like a virus, it does not to **any** harm to your computer

If there is anything that harms your computer in the game, here is what to do to report it. I don't want to harm anyone!
I just want to get a good scare so please. If something fishy is going on (like a libary the game uses going rogue) Please
let me know! Again, I have **zero** intentions of harming your computer and data. I just want to scare you that's all

## How to report

The best way is in the discord server and DMing me. It's what get's my attention the fastest

Before your DM, skip the [hellos](https://nohello.net) and get to the point

Tell me **EVERYTHING** about this.
- How did you find it
- How to do it
- Causes
- **EVERYTHING**

and also send logs if you have any

also screenshots and videos would be nice too!

After that i should be able to fix it within minutes (15 minutes MAX)

> also if you DM me about a really small bug and nothing serious i will block and not interact with you on not only the hazzy discord but every other discord server we share

other ways to reach out is emailing me [at] hazzy-security@drwhomust.xyz
> side note you might get a reply from a complete differnt email but that's because i have email forwarding setup and too lazy and too cheap to set up my own email server

also PM me on newgrounds, i will respound (likey) about this
