# Building from source code

Hazzy does not use RPG Maker's player. We use a javascript player called [Neutralinojs](https://neutralino.js.org/). It's very lightweight and runs really well. Hazzy is also ported to the web to build for that just go into RPG Maker -> Deployment -> Web -> Build

But you may want the desktop app so here is how to build it

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also view NeutralinoJS's [guide](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/distribution/overview) on building. it also works
{% endhint %}

## Building

1. Install NeutralinoJS [here](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app)
2. Clone hazzy source code to your computer
3. go into `hazzy/hazzy/hazzy` in the clone of the source code
4. run `neu build`
5. check the `dist` folder for the completed build
6. enjoy :3 owo
