# Modding basic

## some info

Hazzy is open for modders. You can mod the game how ever you want! want to make a another fan game using hazzy's code. Feel free to, just as long you give proper credit (Like crediting Drwhomust, Toby Fox, KP team, dragonsnow, etc) You are able to use game for mods or your own game.



Now that is out of the way, lets get started

## Opening the project in RPGMaker

The game uses RPGMaker MV, you can get it [here on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV/) or on [RPGMaker's website](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv)

Now, with the software downloaded here is what you need to do.

* Download code (from releases page)
* open `the game code` and open `Game.rpgproject` in RPG Maker
* Then the game should open up in RPG Maker.

from there you can start modding the game.
